/**
 * Created by ibairah on 6/19/20.
 *
 * Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings:
 * (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The
 * occurrences may overlap.)
 *
 * Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible
 * length.  (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer
 * is "".)
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: "banana"
 * Output: "ana"
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: "abcd"
 * Output: ""
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 2 <= S.length <= 10^5
 * S consists of lowercase English letters.
